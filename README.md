# Mission-to-Mars

# Project Overview


The purpose of this project is to adjust Robin’s current web app to include all four of the Mars hemispheres images by incorporating BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full resolution images of Mars’s hemisphere and the titles of those hemispheres. The scraped data will be stored on a Mongo database. The data would be displayed using a web application, and lastly, the web app design would be altered to accommodate those images.


# Resources


Mongo Database, Visual Studio Code, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Splinter, Flask, BeautifulSoup.


# Results


The following steps would be followed for this analysis:
